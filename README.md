# React/Flux Coding Exercise #

## Background ##

Having first read about React many moons ago, my interest was piqued but I never managed to find time to take an in-depth look at it... Angular development has been the main cut and thrust of my day job for the past couple of years, so I've spent most of my time buried deep within that particular ecosystem, or possibly relaxing by the bar and trying to forget all about software engineering.

Time waits for no man though, and nowhere is this truer than within the realms of front-end JS development. So, when I was approached by an agent touting a React job at a prestigious media organisation, I expressed my interest. I was given a technical exercise to perform.

The brief for the task was simple, but I took the opportunity to vastly overengineer the solution and use it as a learning tool for React, Flux and ECMAScript 6, none of which I had previously used.

## The Brief ##

### Display a customer's bill ###

* Use any language, tools or framework
* Consume the bill as JSON from a given endpoint:
```
http://trh-x.com/bill/bill.json
```

### Assessment criteria ###

* TDD/BDD
* Simple and eloquent code
* Knowledge of front end development
* Bill should be easy to understand (good user experience)
